        <h2>Why Sequim?</h2>
        <p>
            After moving from Texas to Washington, I explored many cities — but Sequim stood out instantly.
            It's a peaceful small town filled with cozy cafés, family-owned restaurants, and some of the most
            breathtaking scenery I’ve ever experienced. From lavender fields to mountain views, Sequim feels
            like a place where time slows down in the best way.

                Sequim’s famous lavender festivals were the highlight of my trip. Endless purple fields,
                local vendors, handmade goods, and the calming scent of lavender everywhere — it’s magical.

            <h3>⛰️ Mountains & Coastal Trails</h3>
            <p>
                Coming from Texas, seeing mountains every day still feels unreal. Sequim is close to
                incredible hikes — including a trail that leads to a beach reminiscent of La Push.
